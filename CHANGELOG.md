# v0.6.01
* FIX: All Delay Units > Configuring the max delay time to anything less than 1s resulted in a 0s delay buffer and loss of audio in that chain.

# v0.6.00
* FIX: Soft Keyboard > History was not being saved in some cases.
* FIX: Doppler Delay unit > Maximum delay length can now be configured just like the vanilla Delay unit.
* FIX: Pressing an unrelated button while a long-press menu is showing would result in a crash.
* FIX: The suggested save folder for unit presets has been simplified to ER-301/(version)/presets instead of the now unnecessary ER-301/(version)/presets/(unit-type-name).
* FIX: Teletype CV Unit > Slew limiting is enabled by default with a 2ms rate.
* FIX: Quicksaving when there are unsaved buffers > If you pressed UP or HOME when in the Sample Pool saving buffers, the quicksave was being canceled.  The quicksave should only be canceled if you press CANCEL.
* FIX: G inputs > ADC driver will now reset the ADC hardware when it detects that it is no longer getting interrupts (i.e. timeout).
* NEW: Package Manager > sharing of code and presets via packages.
* NEW: Low Level (C/C++) SDK > It is now possible to dynamically link shared libraries (*.so) to the bare-metal firmware during runtime.  This functionality is accessible via lua's require and package.loadlib interfaces.  Please refer to the core and teletype mod source code for a comprehensive example.

# v0.5.04
* No changes. The purpose of this version is just to upgrade v0.5.03 to a stable release.

# v0.5.03
* NEW: Multitrack Recorder > Number of channels is now configurable (from 6 to 12 channels) via Admin > System Settings > Multitrack Recorder > Channel Count.  Please keep in mind that not all SD cards are fast enough to record this many channels of 48kHz/96kHz audio.  Please test beforehand.
* NEW: SC.TR > Added the 'any' port to the fader (scroll below 1).
* MAYBE FIX: Teletype Integration > Occasionally, an i2c message would sit in the buffer and not get processed until the next message arrives.
* FIX: Slight performance degradation introduced in v0.5.02.
* FIX: Quicksave > The UP button brought the focus to the first slot (HOME) instead of returning you to your previous screen.
* FIX: Multitrack Recorder > Freeze when the SD card cannot keep up with audio recording (i.e. overrun).

# v0.5.02
* SYS: Moved build environment from Code Composer Studio on Windows to GNU make on Linux.
* FIX: Oscilloscope > Reduced the appearance of gaps in traces of waves with discontinuities (e.g. square, saw, and so on). 
* FIX: Teletype Integration > Jitter in message timing grew over time.
* MAYBE FIXED?: Teletype Integration > Need to wait for ER-301 to finish booting before booting other I2C devices.
* FIX: Sample-and-Hold, Track-and-Hold units > Held values were not being restored properly from presets/quicksaves.
* FIX: HOLD mode > When adding an empty PinSet, the new (empty) PinSet rendered with zero width.

# v0.5.01
* FIX: Clicks in the audio when inserting or deleting units or loading presets.
* NEW: Text Entry > Holding a button will repeatedly insert the character or perform the action (i.e. backspace).
* NEW: All sample players that can play slices > Added new Play Extent option called 'cue'. Triggering the player will cause playback to start from the current active slice/cue and play until the end (or beginning if speed < 0).  Afterwards, if looping, then the entire sample will loop.

# v0.5.00
* FIX: 48kHz Low-latency (frame size = 32) firmware > Clicks when recording from IN1-4.
* NEW: 48kHz Low-latency (frame size = 32) firmware > No overruns up to approximately 94% CPU load (previously it was up to 70%).
* NEW: 48kHz Normal-latency (frame size = 128) firmware > No overruns up to approximately 94% CPU load (previously it was up to 84%).
* NEW: 96kHz Normal-latency (frame size = 128) firmware > No overruns up to approximately 92% CPU load (previously it was up to 64%).
* NEW: If there is no ER-301/v0.5 folder on your front SD card then the ER-301/v0.4 folder will be used to populate the new ER-301/v0.5 folder. Previously, you had to do this copy manually when the firmware version had a change in the minor version number (e.g. v0.3 to v0.4 and so on).

# v0.4.27
* FIX: Hold Mode > Enter/Commit and Home/Zero were not working properly when the cursor was over the master fader of a pin set.
* FIX: Custom Units and Bypass > Custom Units were not completely disabled when bypassed.
* FIX: Unit Editor > Duplicate control names were allowed when they should not be allowed.
* FIX: Slice Players > When restoring a preset/quicksave, the 'Play Extent' setting was getting overridden by a change introduced in v0.4.21.
* FIX: Track-and-Hold > "Track when low" mode was not working.
* FIX: Middle Layer > RoundRobin > Implementation was not finished.
* NEW: Saving Unit Preset > If the unit has been renamed, then suggested filename should be based on the unit name.
* NEW: Unit Browser > If a category only contains units from one external library then the library name will be added to the category rather than each unit.

# v0.4.26
* FIX: Hold Mode > Immediately after unpinning a control, it was possible to cause a crash by pressing S2.
* FIX: 6-track recorder > Freeze when trying to record with no SD card mounted.
* FIX: Screensaver > Dialed down the bubbles a bit.

* FIX: Unit > Attach from Card > No error message when out of sample memory.
* NEW: Unit > Attach from Card > You can now load multiple samples as a sample chain when using this command.  Previously this was only available via the Sample Pool.

# v0.4.25
* FIX: Unit Chooser > Stereo-only units were listed in Recents even for mono chains.
* NEW: Mixer Channel > Renamed to Mix for mono chains.  Split into 2 different units for stereo chains, Mono Mix and Stereo Mix.

# v0.4.24
* FIX: Control Editor > A long press on the test fader in the property edit screen would crash the ER-301.
* FIX: 6-track Recorder > When saving multiple tracks, pressing ENTER in the folder browser while having nothing selected would silently fail.
* FIX: Replacing Units > There is some ambiguity about how to order the controls when replacing a unit with another unit that has different controls, especially considering that users can reorder controls at will, as well as add new controls.  Previously the ordering of the replaced control had priority but now I've changed it so that the control order of the new unit (replacer) has priority.
* NEW: Sample Pool > If the "save as" option is not available (because the sample already matches what is on your card) then just hold SHIFT to make it appear.

# v0.4.23
* FIX: Single Cycle > The scan signal was being sampled at frame rate (370Hz) rather than at the audio rate.

# v0.4.22
* FIX: Some frequency readouts were not showing decimals for values less than 1Hz.
* NEW: Single Cycle > A simple and naive wavetable oscillator with morphing.  Load it with a wav file containing a single cycle of your desired waveform, or, load it with a sample chain of single-cycle waveforms and scan.

# v0.4.21
* FIX: Firmware Updater > v0.4.20 broke the internal firmware updater.
* FIX: Screenshots > v0.4.20 broke the ability to create png files.

* FIX: Clocked Player, Clocked Stretch, and any unit with a trigger input > These units were causing a slow memory leak.
* FIX: Scope View > Resource stress by keeping deleted units in memory until the next time you open the scope view.

# v0.4.20
* FIX: Soft Keyboard > Combined text history for file-related operations and unit renaming.
* FIX: Crashes when opening the Source Chooser after loading large quicksaves.
* FIX: More resource leaks plugged. (GraphicContext)

# v0.4.19
* FIX: Memory corruption in the loudness meters and scopes that might have been causing some crashes.
* FIX: Source Chooser > Resource leak when switching between Jacks, Locals, and Globals.

# v0.4.18
* FIX: The data in 8-bit WAV files was being read as signed integers rather than unsigned integers.
* FIX: Move to Mixer > Pinned controls were unpinned after being part of a "Move to Mixer" operation.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Renaming a control in one Pin Set was not propagating to the other Pin Sets that contained the same control.
* FIX: Slice Editor > Pops up message if you attempt to create a loop point where there is no slice.
* NEW: All pin-able controls > Added "pin to all" and "unpin from all" commands to the long press menu.
* NEW: Soft Keyboard > You can now choose from a list of text snippets that were previously entered in a similar UI context (i.e. history).

# v0.4.17
* FIX: Crashes when loading some presets/quicksaves with local connections.
* FIX: 6-track Recorder > When recording a single track, it was not possible to save to an empty folder.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Unusually high CPU load when manipulating a Master Fader.
* FIX: Sample Audition > When browsing for a sample via a unit (not via the Sample Pool) the default audition channel was 1 or last used channel.  Now it will audition on the channel where the unit is located.  Auditioning from the Sample Pool is unchanged.
* FIX: Contextual View > Sample View > The "open editor" command was not working.

# v0.4.16
* FIX: Hold Mode > Sub menu zombies when using any command that removes pinned controls or PinSets.
* NEW: Hold Mode > Added 'Reset Targets' command to PinSets and 'Reset Target' command to pinned faders.  Resetting a target means to move the target value to the current value of the control.

# v0.4.15
* FIX: Unit Header > Swapped 'Replace' and 'Config' commands so that the more often used 'Config' command does not require a SHIFT press.
* FIX: Unit Controls > ZERO (SHIFT+HOME) was not working.
* FIX: Unit Menu > Reinstated access via focus press on a unit header. This means there are 3 ways to access the unit menu: (1) Focus press the header, (2) long press the header and choose 'config', and (3) focus the header and press S3.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Pressing ZERO on a Master Fader would sometimes not work.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Pinned Control > Unpin command was leaving a 'ghost' control behind.
* NEW: Hold Mode > Pressing COMMIT on a Master Fader will immediately set it to 100%.

# v0.4.14
* FIX: Hold Mode > Master faders were reset only on positive movements.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Zero (SHIFT+HOME) was not working on pinned controls.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Pinned Control > Unpin menu item was not working.
* FIX: Hold Mode > Pinned frequency controls were not using log scaling.

# v0.4.13
* FIX: Unit Header > Crash when focusing a unit header and turning the encoder.

# v0.4.12

* FIX: Custom Controls > Renaming a control was not propagating to other parts of the UI properly.
* FIX: Audition > Auditioning on ch2 mutes ch1 and leaves it muted.
* FIX: Quicksaves > Sometimes output chains were not unmuted after loading a quicksave.
* FIX: Unit Deletion > GUI would become unresponsive during deletion of a unit with lots of sub-chains.
* FIX: Local Source Selection > Problems when assigning mono sources to mono destinations within a stereo output chain.
* FIX: File Browser > Saving > Checking if an existing file will be overwritten was not done when entering a new filename.
* FIX: Contextual Sample Views > Zooming interface is now standardized to use the KNOBMODE button like the sample/slice editors.
* FIX: Contextual Sample Views > Channel selection now affects whether the left or right channel of stereo samples are rendered.
* FIX: Offset unit > In stereo chains, the right sub-chain was inadvertently set to output to the left channel and the left input channel was ignored.
* FIX: Loading mono presets into stereo chains (and vice versa) sometimes failed to restore some parameters.
* FIX: Sample Players > 'Play Duration != repeat' should not play on start-up or when changing samples.
* FIX: Locals in Stereo Chains > Having the right channel selected when connecting a mono control yielded "No Signal".
* NEW: Raw Player > Added 'speed' parameter which must be an integer since the Raw Player has no interpolation but allowing reverse playback, pausing, and integer decimation all under remote control.  The default range is -4 to +4 but this can be expanded or reduced via the control editor.
* NEW: New bootloader > This firmware comes with a new bootloader that shortens boot times.
* NEW: Screen Saver > Set activation time in System Settings. Default is 30 mins.
* NEW: Floating Menu > Push and hold (>0.3s) a unit header or control to make a floating menu appear.  Make your selection with the knob and release the button to execute.
* NEW: Custom Units > Renamed to Custom Effect.
* NEW: Hold Mode introduced.
* NEW: Custom Unit > The Custom Unit was split into Custom Source and Custom Effect units.

# v0.4.11

* FIX: Sample & Hold > Mono version was failing to load.
* NEW: Grain Stretch > Jitter control is now modulate-able.

# v0.4.10

* FIX: Units > Header border disappears when bypassing a unit.
* FIX: Sample Slicing/Editing View > S1 in slice view should play from the cursor and suppress external triggering and slice selection.  Additionally, if in slice navigation mode, then S1 actives the highlighted slice.
* FIX: Track|Sample & Hold > Was (still) not saving and restoring its last held value from presets.
* FIX: Multi-band Units > Copying a Custom unit into a Multi-band unit will lose of all of its local connections.
* NEW: Container Unit Name Generation > 3 modes: poet, robot, and off.  The ‘robot’ and ‘off’ modes are completely generic while the ‘poet’ mode uses an internal list of English adjectives and nouns to generate a (nonsense) name. Users can override either or both internal lists by creating and populating ‘ER-301/namegen/adjectives.txt’ and/or ‘ER-301/namegen/nouns.txt’. You can also provide a list of names to suppress by creating ‘ER-301/namegen/suppress.txt’.  This all applies to Multi-band units also.
* NEW: Track|Sample & Hold > Added a fader to visualize and manually change the held value.

# v0.4.09

* FIX: Legacy Presets > v0.3.25 presets and quicksaves should now load.

* FIX: Multi-Band Units > Bypassing the first unit blocked the input signal.
* FIX: Quicksave Sub-display > Total # of units in the quicksave was not being counted correctly.
* FIX: Channel Mute > Not persisted in quicksave.
* NEW: Sample Scanner > Added option to disable interpolation.
* NEW: Insert Unit > Unit and Chain presets can now be loaded directly from the Insert Unit screen.  Unit presets will automatically instantiate the correct unit and chain presets will be loaded inside a Mixer unit.
* NEW: Insert Unit > Browse units alphabetically and by category.  Set default behavior in admin > Settings.
* NEW: Insert Unit > Bespoke units loaded from external libraries (i.e. not built-in) are now labeled with their library name.
* NEW: Bespoke Units > If a bespoke is not found in the original unit library (because the library was renamed or not loaded) then the ER-301 will look for a unit with the same name in the other (loaded) unit libraries.

# v0.4.08

* FIX: Unit > Custom Controls > Occasional crash when performing an operation that affects the position of a control.
* FIX: System > Memory resources were not being released in a timely manner for certain lengthy operations (note to self: Application.postTrigger).

# v0.4.07

* FIX: 6-track Recorder > Crash when trying to assign a local source.
* FIX: Convolution Unit > Removed from the low-latency firmware.
* FIX: Move to Mixer > Outgoing connections were being cleared.
* FIX: Unlinking Channels > Original content is kept in the top (mono) channel only instead of copying to both channels.  This prevents CPU usage from increasing when unlinking channels.
* FIX: Unit > Replace > Missing controls after replacing a unit.
* FIX: Unit > Replace > After replacing a unit, you might get a crash if when accessing the locals view in any of the unit's sub-chains.
* FIX: Unit > Edit Controls > Sometimes sub display graphics remain from a previous operation or focus.
* FIX: Unit > Context Scope > Leaving the context scope view sometimes results in a blank sub display that can only be fixed by moving the cursor away from the control and back on to it.
* FIX: Sample Pool > Edited samples were losing their path information and given generated names such as tmp-buffer-1005.wav and so on, instead of using the original filename and incrementing it.
* NEW: Quicksaves > Cleaned up summary display and now displaying the firmware version of the quicksave, graying out quicksaves that are not compatible.
* NEW: Unit Control > Number Widget > Committing a value will now also defocus the control to prevent inadvertently changing the value with the encoder.
* NEW: Sample Pool > Pressing ENTER will open the sample editor and slicer on the currently highlighted sample.

# v0.4.06

* FIX: Source Assignments > The output of certain sub-chains (note to self: branch output is a ParameterAdapter) was not propagating.
* FIX: Scale Quantizer > Scales are now sorted in dictionary order.
* FIX: Control Editor > Renamed controls were not showing the new name in the editor.
* FIX: Control Editor > Renaming a custom control was causing the control to disappear from presets.
* FIX: All Faders > Sometimes displayed values would have rounding errors (-0.1 would show as -0.099, etc.)
* FIX: Countdown Unit > There were two versions causing confusion, one in testlib and one in builtins.  Removed the one in testlib and fixed the one in builtins to properly count down again.

# v0.4.05

* FIX: All units > Crash when bypassing a unit.
* FIX: All units > Unable to clear the input assignment.

# v0.4.04

* WARNING: This version has no support for presets/quicksaves made with previous firmware versions. I will be looking at what it takes to support the legacy presets over the next few weeks.
* WARNING: There are changes in the middle layer API which means that bespoke units will need to be ported.
* FIX: Custom Units > Are back!
* FIX: Manual Loops > Sample Editor screen loses track of the active sample buffer when making edits.
* FIX: Source Assignments > There was a potential for source assignments using duplicated chains or units (such as when loading presets or pasting from the clipboard) to restore incorrectly.
* FIX: Slices > It was possible for slices to become unsorted and thus out of order with respect to their slice number.
* FIX: Local Sources > Sub-chains were tapped pre-control rather than post-control.
* NEW: Channel Link/Unlink > Linking will keep the contents of the upper chain.  Unlinking will duplicate the contents of the original stereo chain into the 2 resulting mono chains.
* NEW: Buttons > Improved button debouncing.
* NEW: All Faders > Added hysteresis to the encoder control for more precise dialing.
* NEW: All Faders > Focus-pressing Sx or SHIFT+Sx will bring up a numeric widget for dialing in an exact value (between -999,999 and 999,999, ignoring any fader minimum/maximum).  ENTER to commit new value and return.  SHIFT+ENTER to just commit but stay on the widget.  UP or CANCEL to return without committing.
* NEW: Locals > Assignment of the left vs right channel is dictated by which (OUTx) channel is currently selected.
* NEW: Unit Chooser > The 'Recent' category includes any recently pasted unit(s).
* NEW: All Units > You can now add custom controls to any unit and then use them as local sources in any of the sub-chains.
* NEW: Control Editor > Almost all unit controls (both custom and builtin) can be edited now.  Does the range or stepping of the bias or gain not suit your needs? Do you want to invert the output of a gate control or change its latching behavior? Just go to the unit menu and select 'Edit Controls'.
* NEW: Scale Quantizer > Any scala (*.scl) files located in ER-301/scales will be automatically added to the list of available scales.
* NEW UNITS: Two Bands .. Six Bands > Multi-band versions of the Custom Unit which can be used for parallel processing.  The unit's input is routed to each band untouched.  Each band is mixed to unity to produce the unit's output.
* SYS: Refactor > onLoadGraph(channelCount) > Use 'self' in place of 'pUnit'
* SYS: Refactor > ViewControl.Comparator --> ViewControl.Gate
* SYS: Refactor > ViewControl.InputComparator --> ViewControl.InputGate
* SYS: Refactor > ViewControl.PitchControl --> ViewControl.Pitch
* SYS: Refactor > edge Object --> comparator Object
* SYS: Refactor > onLoadViews(objects,branches) ...  return controls, views
* SYS: Refactor > onLoadMenu(objects,branches) ... return controls, menu, (sub)
* SYS: Refactor > self:addBranch(..) --> self:create(Mono|Stereo)Branch("tune", tune, "In", tune,"Out")

# v0.4.03

* FIX: Quicksaves > Since v0.4.02, OUTx chains were being restored on top of each other and sometimes in the wrong channel group.

# v0.4.02

* FIX: Memory leaks when loading quicksaves and certain types of units.
* FIX: Channel Mute > Garbage in the audio buffers was causing audible noise.
* FIX: Channel Mute > Flashing LEDs were not synced and channel selection was hard to see.
* FIX: Teletype > Removed old i2c addresses and set the default i2c address to 0x31 as required by Teletype v3.0.0 and above.
* FIX: Admin > Renamed Load screen to CPU Load.
* FIX: Middle Layer > Enabled compilation of units with internal feedback loops.
* NEW: Channel Setup > Moved out of the admin area and is completely accomplished in the user area by just chording the two channels that you want to link or unlink.

# v0.4.01

* FIX: Sample Auditioning > OUTx chain output would break after auditioning files on the same channels.

* NEW: Mute chain during unit bypass/delete/replace and certain menu operations > Parent chain is muted before performing these operations and then unmuted afterwards.
* NEW: Sustained Slices > Sustain option added to all players (unit menu > Play Duration > sustain) that support slices.  Go to the slicing view to specify the sustained (i.e. looped) segment of each slice.
* NEW: Quicksaving > If there is unsaved audio then a message will be shown giving you the option to go to the Pool and give the unsaved audio buffers a proper place to live on your SD card.
* NEW: Sample Pool > Entries with unsaved audio are now marked with an asterisk (*).
* NEW: Sample Scanner, Manual Grains now have contextual waveform views.
* NEW: Create sample chains On-the-Fly > Whenever you select multiple WAV files to load from the card, you can choose to load them as a (pre-sliced) sample chain.

Sample Player --> Variable Speed Player
Native Player --> Raw Player

# v0.3.18

* FIX: Crash when loading a preset in which a unit fails to load AND it subsequently tries to restore focus to this failed unit because that was what was focused when the preset was saved.
* FIX: When restoring a preset/quicksave from early v0.3.xx firmware, some units were not loading due to changes in unit type names.
* FIX: All gain parameters now go from -10 to 10 (previously -5 to 5).  FM gain now goes from -10k to 10k (prev -5k to 5k).

* FIX: Sample Recorder (Looper) renamed as Manual Looper.
* NEW: Manual Looper > Added menu item to turn latching on and off for the engage and punch controls.
* NEW: Unit Header > Removed the "re-init" command that no one uses and in its place there is now a "replace" command!  Certain units that are similar enough will even bring over control settings and their subchains.

# v0.3.14

* FIX: Pedal Looper > Pressing Undo while Overdubbing was broken.
* NEW: Pedal Looper > Menu item added to choose between rec>play and rec>overdub behavior.
* NEW: Pedal Looper > Menu item added to allow choosing exactly when and when not to pass input.
* NEW: Manual Grains > Added 'squash' parameter which you can use to squash the grain envelope smoothily into a box shape. The effect is the same as passing a Sine Envelope through a Limiter with the squash parameter corresponding to the pre-gain of the Limiter.
